## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate developer who loves building websites and learning new technologies. My goal is to create beautiful, fast, and accessible experiences on the web. Whether it's frontend development or dabbling in backend systems, I'm always exploring and growing.

I started coding in high school, fascinated by how websites worked. Over the years, I've grown from tinkering with HTML and CSS to building full-stack applications. I'm especially interested in user experience, accessibility, and performance optimization.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, contributing to open source, and mentoring junior developers. I'm a strong believer in lifelong learning and love being part of a supportive, innovative tech community.
